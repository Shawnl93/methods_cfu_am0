# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? 9/10 it took a long time but i got it
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? with notes a solid 9.5
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Method to what im understanding is basically a cheat sheet calculator.. you dont have to redo the equation again.
My question while working on the final practice was can you have more than 2 parameters.. and if i did the question on the final practice correctly then the answer would be yes.
