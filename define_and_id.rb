# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")

#The include method is called on the string object "hello world"
#include job is to make sure the word hello is included in hello world


"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

#The end_with? method is called on the string object "hello world"
#to see if it ends hello
#false

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

#hello world does end with rld
#true


12.even?
#asking if the 12 is even
#true

18.next
# asking what is after 18
#19
